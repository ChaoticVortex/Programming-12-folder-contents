* used to create a pointer and to dereference pointers (gets the value pointed to by the pointer)
& gets the memory address of a variable

int * ip; // makes a pointer
int ia[16];

ia[0] = 2;
*ia = 2;
these 2 lines are the same

ia[1] = 3
* (ia + 1) = 3 // pointer arithmetic - the + is overloaded

char a[32] = "Bonjour"; // can both read and write
const char* b = "Hello"; // read only
